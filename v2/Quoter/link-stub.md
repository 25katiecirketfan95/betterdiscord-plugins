## What is this and how did I get here?
This is the Quoter BerrerDiscord plugin help page. Most likely you clicked on the quote of another user who used this plugin in the Discord messenger. You do not have this plugin installed, so you are here. If the plug-in was installed, you would jump to the quoted message.

## I want to do such quotes myself, as well as have the opportunity to jump to messages quoted by other people!
To do this, you need to install the Quoter plugin. For details, refer to [instructions](../../v1/README.md#Installation)

## I want to know more about this plugin
