Original BDv2 plugins are lives here.

If you have any questions, ask them in the [support server](https://discord.gg/MC5dJdE).
## Installation
BDv2 is only alpha now, so this instruction may change in future.
1. Install BetterDiscord v2 as described [here](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp/blob/v2/readme.md#setting-up-a-development-environment)
2. Clone full repository or download plugins folders that you need 
3. Copy or symlink plugin folder into `<BD's basePath>/plugins`
4. For now, you should also install [Lib Discord Internals](1Lib%20Discord%20Internals), as all of my other plugins depends on it.
