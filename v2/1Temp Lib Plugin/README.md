This is temporary plugin, which works as library for other my plugins. It will be removed when this code will be included into BD itself (Jiiks promised to think about it)

If you are plugin developer - you can freely use it. You can see usage examples in [gist](https://gist.github.com/samogot/736dc6289c9fdb9d1f12aba253d530f5) of old version or in my plugins.

## Installation

See instructions for [v1](../../v1#installation) or [v2](../README.md#installation)
