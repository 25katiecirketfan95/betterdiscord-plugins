This is simple plugin for getting back offline users list on large servers. 
Just install it, restart/reload discord, and all servers would be marked as small, so offline user list will be shown. Be careful if you have really large servers with public channels - displaying offline list for them may be laggy.

## Known issues

1. Server which is opened by default on discord startup woun't be patched. I cannot fix it now. Just select any DM or friends list screen and press `Ctrl+R` to reload discord

## Installation

This plugin support both BetterDiscord versions. See installation instructions for [BDv1](../../v1#installation) or [BDv2](../README.md#installation).

This plugin depends on [Temp Lib Plugin](../1Temp%20Lib%20Plugin) so install it too!
