This is simple plugin for getting back offline users list on large servers. 
Just install it, restart/reload discord, and all servers would be marked as small, so offline user list will be shown. Be careful if you have really large servers with public channels - displaying offline list for them may be laggy.

## Known issues

1. Server which is opened by default on discord startup woun't be patched. I cannot fix it now. Just select any DM or friends list screen and press `Ctrl+R` to reload discord

## Installation

See instructions for [v1](../../v1/README.md#Installation) or [v2](../README.md#Installation)
